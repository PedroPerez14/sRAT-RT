# List of things to be done in the near (or far (or very far)) future, in no particular order:

TODO LIST FOR BEING ABLE TO HAVE A RUNNING DEMO:
    - Scene::Scene(), Scene::load_model() and define a proper scene file format!
    - Check that all relevant files have been added to CMakeLists.txt !
    - Refactor the UI rendering? So far it's kinda dirty
    - Move the material IDs list below to a proper .h file? (At least a txt)
    - In my PBR renderer the postprocess and deferred lighting pass shaders are hardcoded, load them from Settings!


    ÃœBERSHADER WITH A MAT_ID AND LOTS OF IFS (shaders LOVE ifs, the elites don't want you to know this)
    List of material ID correspondences between the big ass deferred shader and the material types:
                - NULL  (only for testing purposes)  --- 0
                - DO NOT FUCKING USE THIS SLOT       --- 1
                - PBRMaterial (pbr_material .h .cpp) --- 2
                - ???????                            --- 3
