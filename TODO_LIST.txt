# List of things to be done in the near (or far (or very far)) future, in no particular order:

1.- Allow the definition and loading of custom shaders for the deferred shading pass of the scene (so far it's hardcoded in scene.cpp as {vertex/fragment}_deferred_lighting.glsl)
    1.1.- Where will the users be able to specify it? Config .ini file or scene .xml file?
2.- Define a proper format for our scenes, enabling specificaiton for models, textures, positions, rotations, etc.
    2.1.- Copy Mitsuba's format? Or will it be time consuming? hmmm
    2.2.- Hardcode a test scene? just specify a camera position, shaders, a target texture and a few shaders (deferred lighting are defined by default)



Other tasks:    - Add a few materials and a test scene with a single dir light

TODO LIST FOR BEING ABLE TO HAVE A RUNNING DEMO:
    - Implement the Transform class [DONE]
    - Implement hierarchy Object(abstract)->RenderableObject(inherits)->Model(inherits again): [DONE]
            - Object should have a Transform member                     [DONE]
            - RenderableObject should have a Material member            [DONE]
    - Add the 2 render passes/queues (3 but one of them is just the deferred geometry pass)
    - Later on, implement the hierarchy Object(abstract)->Light(inherits)->{point, dir}
            - Light should have a Transform member
            - More later on, add the areaLight class that inherits from both Light and Model (class Light : virtual Public Object ?)
    - Change Scene::Scene() to load a scene file (also define this format somewhere)
    - Change Scene::load_model() with anything necessary to match the new code structure
    - Modify Model::draw() and Mesh::draw() to take their Material into account
            - Call the Material's set_shader_uniforms() method before drawing!
    - Add Camera class !!
            - Add a Camera member to the Renderer superclass
    - Add all the new files into CMakeLists.txt before compiling!


    NO NEED TO SET UNIFORMS FOR THE DEFERRED LIGHTING PASS AS LONG AS WE PASS THEM INSIDE THE GBUFFER
    DO UPLIFITNG ON THE LIGHTING PASS (PUT ONLY THE RGB ORIGINAL TEX COLORS IN THE GBUFFER)
    
    I CAN HAVE SEVERAL LIGHTING SHADERS IN THE DEFERRED MATERIALS, BUT I NEED TO FIGURE OUT AN ID STRATEGY (SHARE AN ID AMONG ALL THE INSTANCES OF THE SAME SHADER) FOR THE STENCIL BUFFER
                        - Option 1: Material class is an abstraction, define "material types" as a const (static?) map, i.e "pbr"-->shader1, shader2, matID (check floatBitsToInt)
                        - Option 2: Build that fucking shader cache and hash the paths to the vertex + fragment shaders (check floatBitsToInt also)
    THE ALTERNATIVE IS FUCK IT WE BALL: ÃœBERSHADER (ONLY 1 SHADER IN DEFERRED MATERIALS) IN THE DEFERRED QUEUE, AND PUT EVERYTHING AS A MAT_ID
                        - How to figure out the material id? hmmmm --> just hardcode it in the class and be careful? hmmm
